I had an idea where I wanted to put cameras on a club and count exactly how many people were in frame.

I thought it would be easy, famous last words.

I started with a stock video of some overhead video of a club. I dont think I got a super great video. 

Then I used cursor to add some CV techniques to count faces. Faces didnt do the trick so I moved to body counting which was better.

However, the output was still bad.

Then I decided to do some video preprocessing and compare the techniques. See here:

However, still a fail. 

So I dont think I am confident this will work in multiple settings, different colors of clubs etc.

CV is hard!

Idea to continue is to have wrist bands that are reflective. A reflective light would be easier to spot if there was a camera on the roof which detected the wrist bands. 
However, this would require an investment from the bars and clubs.
